5. Test Case
  - **SEARCH TRAIN FROM `LHR TO ISL` ON `14 JUNE 2024`**
    - *Seamless Travel  (journey is continuous)*
       - `LHR -> ISL`  11:00 GMT - 18:00 GMT `(BlueWays)`
    - *Segmented Travel (journey divided in two parts)*
       - `LHR -> GRW` `(VelocityExpress)` 05:00 GMT - 08:25 GMT  + `GRW -> ISL` `(EagleRide)` 09:50 GMT - 14:30 GMT  
       - `LHR -> GRW` `(VelocityExpress)` 05:00 GMT - 08:25 GMT  + `GRW -> ISL` `(NeoSpark)` 11:30 GMT - 15:50 GMT  


6. Important Note
  - **You cannot change or update profile or password of Default User(maaz khan) even you cannot `delete or edit` default user and admin from admin panel.**

  - **In deployed version `TIME` is showing in `UTC (Universal Time Coordinated)` but if you setup the project locally it will show according to your location by adding appropriate hours as shown in ScreenShots**

  - **The final attributes of the database tables may be `slightly different` from the attributes of entities in `SCHEMA.pdf` So you should always see tables definition in `SQL Server`**

  - **(If you want to travel from station A to B)**
     - you should have stations `A & B`
     - you should have track between `A & B`
     - you should have a train
     - you should have carriage/s in it
     - you should have a route defined from `A -> B` on your trip Data
